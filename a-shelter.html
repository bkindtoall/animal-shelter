      <h2>Buddy the Lover</h2>
      <p>Buddy is in a foster home and is currently not at the shelter. Please see info below on how to adopt him - thanks Dynamic Dog Seeks Forever Family: Me: Athletic and energetic, I love playing with other dogs. Im a little over a year old, and a tall, lovable mix of Ibizan Hound and some other good stuff! Im a great hiking/jogging/fast walking partner, and a real life, "talking" doorbell: which translates to, Ill let you know when we have guests! At the end of a productive day, I want to lay in your lap! Im shy with new people but get attached quickly. I'm a leggy 65 pounds or so. You: Can provide the active lifestyle I need, plenty of chew toys, and have experience using reward-based training techniques. Id love a yard to play games with my dog sibling and/or friends. A committed, invested family is very important! Kids make me a little uneasy, but with slow introductions, Id probably welcome a dog-savvy, feline sibling.</p>

      <h2>Poundbury loves you</h2>
      <p>Poundbury is a great, green-eyed sidekick. He is playful, sweet, and gentle. He loves head scratches and bonds quickly and deeply with humans. He comes when called and sleeps quietly on your bed at night. He is friendly and outgoing with low anxiety (not a "fraidy cat"). He communicates with quiet meows letting you know when he wants you to open a door or pet him. He likes to play with the laser pointer and is an expert bug hunter. He also likes watching TV and has been known to binge watch nature shows! He has moments when he tears through the house blowing off steam, but then settles in for a nice, long nap. He is an all-around great cat and super companion. He will settle in quickly and easily with his new people in his forever home.</p>

      <h2>Rex is ready to Play</h2>
      <p>Rex came into the shelter neglected and in tremendous pain from untreated ear infections that ended up needing surgery to resolve. He has now healed from surgery and is learning how great life can be in a loving foster home! His past life makes him wary of sudden movements and body handling from strangers, so only homes with older or more mature kids please. Once he gets to know you, he's a great cuddler and loves to snuggle on the couch. This handsome shepherd boy is a gentleman in the home, loves to chew on balls and rope toys and is making great progress on learning how to calmly walk on leash. He can become very excited around other dogs so is looking to be the only dog in the home and would not be a good candidate for dog parks.</p>
